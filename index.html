        <p>A comprehensive overview of web development, its components, and tools.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications. It involves writing code, designing layouts, and organizing information to create functional and visually appealing online experiences.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Brief History</h2>
        <p>The history of web development traces back to the creation of the first website by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. Over the years, it has evolved significantly, incorporating advanced technologies and practices to enhance user experience and functionality.</p>

        <h2>Key Components of Web Development</h2>

        <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
        <p>Front-end development refers to creating the visual and interactive elements of a website that users directly interact with. It involves using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong> (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong>: Defines the structure and content of web pages.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong>: Styles the layout, appearance, and presentation of HTML elements.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, such as animations, form validation, and interactive features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Back-End Development</h3>
        <p>Back-end development involves creating the server-side logic and infrastructure of a website or web application. It handles behind-the-scenes functionality that powers the front-end and manages data. Common programming languages used include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"target="_blank">Ruby</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.php.net/"target="_blank">PHP</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wki/javascript">Javascript</a></li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Programming and Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>Programming is the act of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. These instructions are written in a programming language, which the computer can understand and execute. Popular programming languages include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wki/javascript">Javascript</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Development Tools</h2>
        <p>Web developers use various tools to write and manage code:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Text Editors</strong>: Basic tools like Notepad (Windows) and TextEdit (macOS).</li>
            <li><strong>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</strong>: Advanced platforms like Visual Studio Code that offer features like syntax highlighting, debugging tools, and version control integration.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction to GitHub</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaboration on software development projects. It allows developers to store and manage their code repositories, track changes, and collaborate with others. Key features of GitHub include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Version Control</strong>: Tracks changes to the codebase over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Facilitates teamwork with features like pull requests, issue tracking, and code reviews.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Hosting</strong>: Provides a secure and reliable platform for hosting code repositories.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Basic Git Commands</h2>
        <p>To work with GitHub, you need to understand basic Git commands, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>init</strong>: Initialize a new Git repository.</li>
            <li><strong>add</strong>: Add files to the staging area.</li>
            <li><strong>commit</strong>: Commit changes to the repository.</li>
            <li><strong>push</strong>: Push changes to a remote repository.</li>
            <li><strong>pull</strong>: Pull changes from a remote repository.</li>
            <li><strong>clone</strong>: Clone a repository into a new directory.</li>
        </ul>
